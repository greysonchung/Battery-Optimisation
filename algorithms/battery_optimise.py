def battery_optimisation(datetime, spot_price, initial_capacity=0, include_revenue=True, solver: str='glpk'):
    """
    Determine the optimal charge and discharge behavior of a battery based 
    in Victoria. Assuming pure foresight of future spot prices over every 
    half-hour period to maximise the revenue.
    PS: Assuming no degradation to the battery over the timeline and battery cannot
        charge and discharge concurrently.
    ----------
    Parameters
    ----------
    datetime        : a list of time stamp
    spot_price      : a list of spot price of the corresponding time stamp
    initial_capacit : the initial capacity of the battery
    include_revenue : a boolean indicates if return results should include revenue calculation
    solver          : the name of the desire linear programming solver (eg. 'glpk', 'mosek', 'gurobi')

    Returns
    ----------
    A dataframe that contains battery's opening capacity for each half-hour period, spot price
    of each half-hour period and battery's raw power for each half-hour priod
